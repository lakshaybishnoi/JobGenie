It’s rare that a new asset class is born. Nevertheless, we’re witnessing exactly that with the rise of crypto. Over just the last few years, crypto has evolved from an embryonic $50B market to a growing $3T+ juggernaut. At Bitwise, we believe that crypto has reached a turning point, and is headed north of $10T over the next few years.

This is an exciting moment for Bitwise as a firm. For seven years, we have established a track record of excellence managing a broad suite of index and active solutions across ETFs, separately managed accounts, private funds, staking solutions, and hedge fund strategies. This year, we crossed $12B in client assets and are growing quickly. Thousands of financial advisors, family offices, and institutional investors partner with Bitwise to understand and access the opportunities in crypto.

We are known for providing unparalleled client support through expert research and commentary, a nationwide client team of crypto specialists, and deep access to the crypto ecosystem.

Currently, Bitwise is a close-knit team of 90+ professionals. Think of us as a mix of an asset manager and a tech start-up. We’re backed by some of the most accomplished investors in venture capital and veterans of the financial services world. We love working together, we love what we do, and we’re excited about what’s ahead.

We’re looking for an exceptional individual to join the engineering team to help Bitwise scale and our clients succeed. As Bitwise’s next software engineer, you'll be able to have a major impact from day one, within our small, yet quickly growing business. The products and systems you build will touch all parts of the organization and will give you the opportunity to understand our business deeply, which is rare.

You need not worry about bureaucracy at Bitwise — we pride ourselves on moving fast and being nimble. We’re a tight-knit, multi-disciplinary team and you’ll be on the ground floor of what we’re building.
What You Will Do
• You’ll build products from the ground up — from data infrastructure to backend APIs. You will be able to manage your own work by deciding what needs to be built, communicating with stakeholders directly, and managing your own time. You will be given the autonomy to get work done efficiently without unnecessary bureaucracy.
• As a member of a small team, you will contribute meaningfully to building our engineering organization. This includes playing an important role in making technical decisions, defining Bitwise’s engineering standards, and determining best practices. We are not set in our ways and are always willing to explore new technologies and tools.
• You will have the opportunity to experience rapid growth and work on the highest impact initiatives within the company. In the process, you will shape product and engineering strategy at the company.
• You will have the opportunity to spend time learning about crypto and building expertise in a nascent, rapidly changing, and growing industry.
• You will wear many hats, contribute to many projects, and adapt to the needs of a growing organization.
Who You Are
• The idea of being early on a small team where things change rapidly and everyone pitches in excites you.
• Your style is like ours: high energy, positive, caring, deliberate, self-aware, curious, and open-minded, inclined to take ownership to get the best outcome but happy to transfer or share ownership with others. You’re proactive in pursuing what you want, you take pride in your ability to communicate and connect with others, and you’re always looking to improve.
• You’re an analytical thinker. You love detail, but also don’t let preparation get in the way of action.
• You are a great communicator, in writing and conversation, and can convey details with clarity and coherence.
• You care about relationships, both within the team and with external partners. You want to understand others, to help others understand you, to enjoy interactions, to form career-long partnerships, and to be “best-in-class.”
